Text-to-SQL Large Language Models (LLMs) are AI-driven systems that transform natural language queries into structured SQL code. These models are trained on vast datasets that include natural language statements and their corresponding SQL queries, enabling them to understand and process user intent effectively. 
1. **Natural Language Understanding**: Accepts queries in plain English (or other supported languages) and maps them to the appropriate SQL commands.
2. **SQL Generation**: Outputs syntactically correct SQL queries based on the user's request.
3. **Database Schema Awareness**: Understands database structures, table relationships, and field types to ensure query accuracy.
4. **Dynamic Query Handling**: Supports basic to complex SQL constructs, including filtering, joins, aggregation, and nested queries.

### Use Cases:
- Querying databases without requiring SQL expertise.
- Automating data retrieval tasks in business intelligence tools.
- Providing SQL assistance for developers and analysts.
